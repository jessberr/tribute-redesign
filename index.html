                    <h3>Wild Geese</h3>
                    <pre>You do not have to be good.
          You do not have to walk on your knees
          for a hundred miles through the desert
          repenting.
          You only have to let
          the soft animal of your body love
          what it loves.
          Tell me about despair, yours,
          and I will tell you mine.
          Meanwhile the world goes on.
          Meanwhile the sun
          and the clear pebbles of the rain
          are moving across the landscapes,
          over the prairies and the deep trees,
          the mountains and the rivers.
          Meanwhile the wild geese,
          high in the clean blue air,
          are heading home again.
          Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
          the world offers itself to your imagination,
          calls to you like the wild geese,
          harsh and exciting -
          over and over announcing your place
          in the family of things.</pre>

                    <h3>Luke</h3>
                    <pre>I had a dog
          who loved flowers.
          Briskly she went
          through the fields,
          
          yet paused
          for the honeysuckle
          or the rose,
          her dark head
          
          and her wet nose
          touching
          the face
          of every one
          
          with its petals
          of silk,
          with its fragrance
          rising
          
          into the air
          where the bees,
          their bodies
          heavy with pollen,
          
          hovered—
          and easily
          she adored
          every blossom,
          
          not in the serious,
          careful way
          that we choose
          this blossom or that blossom—
          
          the way we praise or don’t praise—
          the way we love
          or don’t love—
          but the way
          
          we long to be—
          that happy
          in the heaven of earth—
          that wild, that loving.</pre>

                    <h3>I Want to Write Something
          So Simply</h3>
                    <pre>I want to write something
          so simply
          about love
          or about pain
          that even
          as you are reading
          you feel it
          and as you read
          you keep feeling it
          and though it be my story
          it will be common,
          though it be singular
          it will be known to you
          so that by the end
          you will think—
          no, you will realize—
          that it was all the while
          yourself arranging the words,
          that it was all the time
          words that you yourself,
          out of your own heart
          had been saying.</pre>
